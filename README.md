# Spark-Gremlin

Spark-Gremlin is an implementation of the Blueprints Graph API (http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com/)
and the Gremlin Graph Traversal Language (http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com/) implmented using 
Spark (http://spark.apache.org/)

## Status

Spark-Gremlin is very early alpha. The Blueprints API implementation is mostly complete, but there may be
some holes and non-optimial code. The Gremlin implementation is only a fraction complete, there is still 
a lot of work to be done. 

## Building Spark-Gremlin
